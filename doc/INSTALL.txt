To build a stand-alone HaMLet program under Unix-like systems,
invoke one of the following commands:

	make with-alice		(for Alice ML 1.4+)
	make with-mlkit		(for ML Kit 4.3+)
	make with-mlton		(for MLton 20010706+)
	make with-mosml		(for Moscow ML 2.0+)
	make with-poly		(for Poly/ML 5.0+)
	make with-smlnj		(for SML/NJ 110+)
	make with-smlsharp	(for SML# 0.20+)

depending on what SML system you want to compile with.
This will produce an executable named "hamlet".
(For Moscow ML versions prior to 2.10 you will need to patch the definition of FIXES_mosml as indicated in the Makefile.)

Alternatively, you can invoke

	use "hamlet.sml";

from an interactive SML prompt, which employs SML's `use' function.
As yet another possibility, a single file containing all modules can be
generated with

	make hamlet-bundle.sml

for easy compilation with systems not supporting any of the above options.

To compile under DOS-based systems you can either use the simple-minded
"make.bat" batch file that fakes the commands above, or you install some
`make' substitute (e.g. via Cygwin) and patch the Makefile according to
the contained comments. [Note: make.bat is currently broken.]

Under Unixes, you have the option of installing HaMLet:

	make INSTALLDIR=mypath install

The default for mypath is /usr/local/hamlet.

Please see the documentation in directory doc for more details.
