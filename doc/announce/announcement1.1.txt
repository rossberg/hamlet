I am pleased to announce the release of version 1.1 of HaMLet. The new version mainly featues changes to the library:

  - conformance with the latest incarnation of the SML Basis Library
    specification (http://SML.sourceforge.net/Basis/),
  - a bunch of additional library structures,
  - some bug fixes.

HaMLet is a faithful implementation of the Standard ML programming language (SML'97) that aims to be

  - an accurate reference implementation of the language specification,
  - a platform for experimentation with the language semantics,
  - a useful tool for educational purposes.

The HaMLet sources are intended to be as direct a translation of the language formalisation as possible. Even program evaluation is performed by a direct implementation of the rules of the dynamic semantics. The source code is heavily cross-referenced.

HaMLet can perform different phases of execution - like parsing, type checking, and evaluation - selectively. In particular, it is possible to execute programs in an untyped manner, thus exploring the universe where even ML programs "can go wrong".
