  (thanks to El Pin Al).

  (thanks to Arata Mizuki).


2.0.0 (2013/10/10)

Interpreter functionality:
- Print source location for uncaught exceptions.

1.2 (2005/02/04):

Interpreter:
- Refactored code to avoid cross-module recursion issues and make experiments
  with extensions more convenient: semantic objects are now collected in one
  structure for each part of the semantics; type variable scoping and closure
  computation (expansiveness check) are separated from elaboration module.
- Made checking of syntactic restrictions a separate pass. This renders
  parsing and evaluation-only functionality more accurate, though it complicates
  things significantly, since it requires complete binding analysis.
