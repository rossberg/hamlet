 * Standard ML objects of the static semantics
 *
 * Definition, Sections 4.1, 4.2, and Appendix E
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Unification is destructive, hence types are wrapped in references.
 * - Undetermined types are represented separately from type variables.
 *   They carry an additional time stamp to detect attempts of referring to
 *   types not in scope. The time stamps are also used to prevent invalid
 *   unification with skolem types (i.e. newer type names) during signature
 *   matching. Time stamps are propagated during unification.
 * - When undetermined types get determined, they are replaced by forward links.
 * - To represent overloaded type (variables), we also add a special type.
 * - Record types may contain a row variable to represent open record types
 *   (which appear during type inference). Flexible rows have to carry an
 *   equality flag and time stamp to properly propagate information enforced
 *   by unification when extending a row.
 * - Env is modelled by a datatype to deal with type recursion.
 * - We call the domain type of value environments ValStr.
