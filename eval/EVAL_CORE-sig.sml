 * Definition, Section 6.7
 *
 * Notes:
 * - State is passed as reference and modified via side effects. This way
 *   expanding out of the state and exception convention in the inference
 *   rules can be avoided (which would really be a pain). Note that the state
 *   therefore never is returned.
 * - Doing so, we can model the exception convention using exceptions.
 * - Since exception names are generated by stamps we do not really need the
 *   exception name set. We maintain it anyway.
